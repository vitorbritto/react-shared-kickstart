## Getting Started

Develop your project and when it's time to share, run one of the procedures below.

**Share and publish using Surge**

> You must have **Surge** installed on your machine. Run `npm i -g surge`

1. Run `npm run surge` to build the app for production
2. Execute `surge` (If this is your first time running surge you'll be prompted to create an account. Add an email and password, then hit enter.)
3. Visit the domain generated by surge
4. Profit!

**Share and publish using Github Pages**

> You must install **gh-pages** before as dependency. Run `npm i -D gh-pages` or `yarn add --dev gh-pages`

1. Edit the field "homepage" in `package.json` updating the repository and user by yours.
2. Run `npm run gh` to build the app for production
3. Head to your project’s repository settings on GitHub. In the GitHub Pages section, confirm that your project is set to use the gh-pages branch.
